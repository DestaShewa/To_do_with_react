(To create a GIF like this, you can use free tools like Giphy Capture on Mac or ScreenToGif on Windows)
This is a feature-rich, single-page To-Do List application built with React and Vite. It serves as a comprehensive project for demonstrating core and advanced React concepts, including state management, component composition, side effects, and modern UI development with Tailwind CSS.
✨ Features
This application goes beyond a simple to-do list and includes a full suite of features to manage your tasks effectively:
Full CRUD Functionality: Create, Read, Update (Edit), and Delete tasks.
In-Place Editing: Double-click on a task's text to edit it directly in the list.
Task Filtering: Dynamically filter tasks by All, Active, and Completed statuses.
Live Text Search: Instantly filter the list by typing into the search bar.
Browser Persistence: Tasks are saved in the browser's localStorage, so your to-do list is preserved even after a page reload.
Task Count: A footer that dynamically displays the number of remaining active tasks.
Clear Completed: A convenient button to remove all completed tasks at once.
Confirmation on Delete: A browser confirmation dialog prevents accidental deletion of tasks.
Fully Responsive: The layout is built with Tailwind CSS and is optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.
🛠️ Technologies & Libraries Used
This project was built using a modern, efficient tech stack:
React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
Vite: A next-generation frontend tooling that provides a fast and lean development experience.
Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom designs.
JavaScript (ES6+): Used for all the application logic.
HTML5 & CSS3: For structure and fundamental styling.
🚀 Getting Started
Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.
Prerequisites
You need to have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your computer. You can download them from the official website.
Installation & Setup
Clone the repository:
Open your terminal and clone this repository to your local machine using git.
Generated bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME.git
Use code with caution.
Bash
Navigate to the project directory:
Generated bash
cd YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME
Use code with caution.
Bash
Install dependencies:
This command will read the package.json file and install all the necessary libraries (like React, Tailwind, etc.).
Generated bash
npm install
Use code with caution.
Bash
Run the development server:
This command starts the Vite development server, which will watch your files for changes and provide a live preview.
Generated bash
npm run dev
Use code with caution.
Bash
Open the application:
Once the server is running, it will provide a local URL (usually http://localhost:5173). Open this URL in your web browser to see the application in action.
🏗️ Project Structure
The project follows a standard Vite + React structure, with all application-specific code located in the src directory.

💡 Learning Objectives & Concepts Demonstrated
This project is an excellent demonstration of key React concepts:
Component-Based Architecture: The application is broken down into small, reusable components (TodoItem, TodoForm, etc.).
State Management with useState: Managing the list of todos, filter status, and search terms.
Handling User Events: Capturing user input and clicks to trigger state updates.
Props: Passing data and functions from parent to child components (e.g., from App down to TodoItem).
Conditional Rendering: Displaying UI elements based on the application's state (e.g., showing the footer only when tasks exist).
Lifting State Up: Centralizing state in a common ancestor component (App.jsx) to be shared among siblings.
Side Effects with useEffect: Using useEffect to sync the to-do list with the browser's localStorage.
Rendering Lists with .map(): Dynamically creating a list of components from an array of data, with a unique key for each item.
Controlled Components: Linking form input values directly to React state.
Styling with Tailwind CSS: Using utility classes directly in JSX for efficient and responsive styling.
Future Improvements
While feature-rich, there's always room for more! Here are some ideas for future development:
Drag-and-Drop Reordering: Allow users to reorder tasks by dragging them.
Light/Dark Mode: Add a theme toggle to switch between a light and dark UI.
Animations: Use a library like Framer Motion to add smooth animations for adding, deleting, and reordering tasks.
Backend Integration: Connect the app to a backend service (like Firebase or a custom Node.js API) to store tasks in a database.
